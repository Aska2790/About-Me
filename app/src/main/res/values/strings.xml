\nI love fish
\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean
\nFun facts is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - bot so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\nI`ll be happy to teach you how to make you own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.<br/>
